        <p>Crystal Empire is a game based of a popular roblox game called blox fruits.
            In Crystal Empire you can pick two sides either human or skydweller.
            If you pick human you will unlock a huge variety of swords, guns, fighting styles and armours.
            If you pick Skydweller then you will unlock the powerful shards but will have a very limited amout of
            weapons.
            The plot of the game is that a strange creature is taking over the land and you will have to save the world.
            You start off at the skyislands where you are an outsider because of many wars between the humans and
            skydellers.
            You end up growing close bonds between the skydwellers and come back the the horrifying now corrupted land.
            Once you save the land you find the creatures last resort in his own territory underground.
            Will you save the world? Or will you fail and perish? The choice is up to you.
